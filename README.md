# Data Structures

In this repository I've learned more about different data structures. How the set up e.g. a list and the different ways how to edit a list. 

1. Lists
2. Sets
3. Mutability (Tuples)
4. Dictionaries

At the end of each section there are some questions which I answerd and marked it always with **# Question**.

## Additionally 

The course is based on agile work methods - so we started with pair programming and learned the benefits of daily standups and reviews. 
One thing which I learned to keep in mind during the course is always think about the Data Science lifecycle.
